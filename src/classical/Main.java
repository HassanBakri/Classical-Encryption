				  "RADIUS: REMOTE AUTHENTICATION DIAL-IN USER SERVICERADIUS is by "

				+ "can be attributed to Livingston’s decision to open the distribution of the RADIUS source code. Users were quick to port the service across"
				+ "multiple platforms and add customized features, many of which Livingston"
				+ "incorporated as standard features in later releases. Today, versions"
				+ "of the RADIUS server are available for every major operating system from"
				+ "both freeware and commercial sources, and the RADIUS client comes"
				+ "standard on NAS products from every major vendor.A basic RADIUS server implementation references two configuration"
				+ "files. The client configuration file contains the address of the client and the shared secret used to authenticate transactions. The user file contains"
				+ "the user identification and authentication information (e.g., user ID and "
				+ " password) as well as connection and authorization parameters. Parameters are passed between the client and server using a simple five-field format"
				+ "encapsulated into a single UDP packet"));
